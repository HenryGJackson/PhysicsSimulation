# Makefile based on one from this page: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html


# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies
#               (dependencies are added to end of Makefile)
# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files
#

# define the C compiler to use
CXX = g++

# define any compile-time flags
CFLAGS = -Wall -g #-std=c++11

# define any directories containing header files other than /usr/include
#
INCLUDES = -I/home/henry/C++/simulation/incl

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib I'd specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
LFLAGS = -L/home/henry/C++/simulation/src

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname
#   option, something like (this will link in libmylib.so and libm.so:
LIBS = -lm #-lmylib

# define the C source files
SRCS = interface/interface.cpp src/obj.cpp\
src/tools/* src/Forces/* src/Particles/* src/Astro/* src/Systems/* src/macros/*


# define the C object files
#
# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
#   $(name:string1=string2)
#         For each word in 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
# Below we are replacing the suffix .c of all words in the macro SRCS
# with the .o suffix
#
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

# define the executable file
MAIN = LetsGo

#
# The following part of the makefile is generic; it can be used to
# build any executable just by changing the definitions above and by
# deleting dependencies appended to the file from 'make depend'
#

# this is a suffix replacement rule for building .o's from .c's
# it uses automatic variables $<: the name of the prerequisite of
